## Core Approach
### **High-Performance Computation**
- **Algorithmic Modeling**: Python-based research framework with C++/Rust/Zig cores
- **Latency-Sensitive Components**: Hand-optimized Assembly routines
- **FPGA Acceleration**: VHDL/Verilog implementations for critical path optimization

### **Cross-Platform Execution**
- .NET integration via C# for exchange connectivity
- Multi-architecture deployment capabilities

## Key Differentiators
1. **Cost Efficiency Architecture**
   - Proprietary toolchain reduces cloud dependencies
   - ASIC/FPGA-accelerated risk calculations

2. **Microstructure Analysis**
   - Topological data methods for order book dynamics
   - Multi-factor regime detection models

3. **Research Rigor**
   - First-principles market hypothesis testing
   - Automated strategy validation pipelines
